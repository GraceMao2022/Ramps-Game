Basics:
1. Use your knowledge of physics to calculate how far you 
think the block will go on the flat surface. 

2. You will see given values at the top-left corner of 
the screen. Use them to calculate the distance the block 
will travel on the ground.

3. Set down your mark on the flat ground to the right of 
the ramp. Once you have done that, press "Start 
Simulation" to start the simulation.

Note: Assume there is no upward force acting on the block
when it hits the ground. Also assume that static friction
is equal to kinetic friction.

How To Win:
The distance will be calculated between where you 
marked and where the block ends (where does the 
middle of the block end). A score will be calculated 
based on that. 

If you get 90 points or more, you win! If not, try 
harder next time and look at the explanation provided.

PhyInfo:
You can resolve the force of gravity into two forces: one parallel 
to the ramp (we will call parGForce) and one perpendicular to the ramp
(we will call perGForce), as shown by the image above.

Using trigonometry, you find out that (as shown above):
parGForce = m*g*sin(@)
perGForce = m*g*cos(@)
where m = mass of block, g = force of gravity on Earth, and
@ = angle formed by ramp and ground
+++++
1) Find cos@ and sin@
	Since slope = tan@, and tan^2(@)+1 = sec^2(@), you get
	slope^2+1 = sec@. If you continue solving for cos@, you will get 
	cos@ = 1/sqrt(slope^2+1).
	
	Since tan@ = sin@/cos@, you get sin@ = tan@*cos@, which is
	sin@ = slope*cos@.
	
2) Find the forces on the ramp
	We know that:
	perGForce = m*g*sin@
	parGForce = m*g*cos@
	
	Also the NForce, or force that goes opposite of the perGForce is
	equal to the perGForce
	NForce = perGForce 
	
	The friction acting on the block when it's moving is 
	friction = NForce*frictCoef (friction coefficient)
	
3) Find the acceleration on the ramp
	Acceleration on the ramp (acce_Ramp) is:
	acce_Ramp = (parForce - friction)/m
	
4) Find the total time on the ramp
	timeOnRamp = sqrt(2*lengthOfRamp/acce_Ramp)
------	
5) Find the forces on the ground
	When the block is on the ground, the force of gravity directly
	acts perpendicular to the block. Therefore:
	perForce = m*g
	And there is no parForce.
	
	Same as when the block was on the ramp,
	NForce = perForce
	friction_Ground = NForce*frictCoef
	
6) Find the acceleration on the ground
	Acceleration on the ground (acce_Ground) is:
	acce_Ground = -friction/m
	
7) Get the initial speed once the block hits the ground
	The initial speed is:
	initialSpeedOnGround = acce_Ramp * timeOnRamp
	
8) Find total time on the ground
	timeOnGround = -initialSpeedOnGround/acce_Ground
	
9) Find distance traveled on ground
	distance = -0.5*acce_Ground*timeOnGround^2

- You can change the settings to your preferable username, mass
of the block, range of the slope, range of the friction 
coefficient, and color of the ramp and block

- You need 1000 points to unlock a color for the ramp or
block. Points are earned through game play.

- The minimum the slope can be is -5.6, and the maximum it can be
is -0.5. You won't be allowed to set anything outside of this range.
This is to prevent the block from stopping on the ramp or going off the 
screen.

- The minimum the friction coefficient can be is 0.18, and the maximum 
it can be is 0.4. You won't be allowed to set anything outside of this 
range. This is to prevent the block from stopping on the ramp or going 
off the screen.
